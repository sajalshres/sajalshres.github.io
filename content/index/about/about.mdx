import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining";

I love programming, and learning anything about it.

During the day, I work as a <Underlining highlight>Technical Lead</Underlining> and <Underlining highlight>Senior Software Engineer</Underlining>
at <a href="https://www.cotiviti.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Cotiviti, INC.</a>

During the evenings, I spend most of my time building personal projects, contributing to open-source library and learning new stuff.

I also have passion for teaching programming and software development. You can find some of the learning resources at my <Underlining highlight>github profile</Underlining>

My main expertise is in <Underlining highlight>devops</Underlining>, <Underlining highlight>back-end</Underlining>
and <Underlining highlight>front-end</Underlining> development.
